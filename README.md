when ur landlord charges extra rent sometimes the next best thing is to create a virtual pet :(
i used tkinter to show cute images of your lil critter and to create sliders which you can use to check their hunger, happiness and energy !!! 
sort of like the sims but probably less fun lol :/
i will probably update this at some point so the pics of your pet will more accurately represent their mood,
i've literally just copied the sims tbh
